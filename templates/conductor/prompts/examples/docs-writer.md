# API Documentation Enhancement Request

You are enhancing documentation for this API endpoint:

## Endpoint Details

**Path:** `{{endpointPath}}`
**Method:** `{{method}}`

## Current Specification

```json
{{endpointSpec}}
```

## Your Task

Transform this technical specification into clear, helpful documentation that:

1. **Explains the purpose** - What does this endpoint do? Why would someone use it?

2. **Provides context** - When should developers use this vs alternatives? What are the trade-offs?

3. **Shows realistic examples** - Create request/response examples that reflect actual use cases, not just placeholder data.

4. **Anticipates questions** - What would a developer wonder about? What gotchas should they know?

5. **Guides to success** - What are the best practices? What mistakes should they avoid?

## Guidelines

- Use clear, conversational language (but stay technically accurate)
- Explain in terms of USER GOALS, not system internals
- Include realistic values in examples (not "string" or "123")
- Highlight edge cases and limitations
- Make error messages actionable ("do this to fix")
- Add notes about rate limits, caching, or performance

## Output Format

Return a complete JSON object following the schema defined in the system prompt.
Make it so good that developers:
- Understand it immediately
- Can copy-paste the example and have it work
- Know exactly what to do when something goes wrong
- Feel confident using this API

Remember: Great documentation is the difference between a developer choosing your API or looking for alternatives.
