### New Features

- **Interactive status commands** - All status commands (conductor, edgit, cloud) now detect uninitialized state and offer Y/n prompts to initialize interactively.

- **Multiple output modes** - Status commands support `--json` for CI/scripting and `--compact` for minimal output. All modes properly handle uninitialized state with appropriate error fields.

- **CI-safe behavior** - JSON and compact modes return immediately without interactive prompts. Non-interactive environments (CI) show hints instead of prompts.

### Bug Fixes

- **Zero-config local development** - The AI binding in `wrangler.toml` is now commented out by default, allowing `pnpm run dev` to work immediately without Cloudflare authentication. Users can enable Workers AI via `ensemble configure` when ready.

- **Init wizard reliability** - Fixed the wizard flow with proper operation order (create structure → install deps), fail-fast behavior on errors, and better directory handling with clear error messages.

### Improvements

- **ASCII art banners** - Added product-specific ASCII art banners (Conductor, Edgit, Cloud, Ensemble) with automatic fallback to emoji banners on narrow terminals (<60 cols).

- **Cleaner wizard output** - Single banner on startup, silent dependency installation with clean summary, conditional success messages based on actual outcome.

- **Removed placeholder commands** - Cleaned up unused login and config command stubs.
