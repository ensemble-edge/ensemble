Add Spinner.warn method and decouple edgit via subprocess spawning

**Spinner Enhancement:**
- Added `warn()` method to Spinner interface in `src/ui/spinner.ts`
- Displays warning icon (⚠) with optional custom text
- Maintains consistent API with existing `success()` and `error()` methods

**Edgit Version Decoupling:**
- Changed edgit integration from direct import to subprocess spawning via npx
- Removed `@ensemble-edge/edgit` from dependencies
- Updated `runEdgit()` in router.ts to use `spawnCommand("npx", ["edgit", ...args])`
- Provides helpful install message if edgit is not found

**Router Improvements:**
- Edgit commands now pass through to npx subprocess
- Allows ensemble and edgit to version independently
- Uses edgit's own help formatting and command routing

**Test Updates:**
- Updated router tests to verify subprocess spawning behavior
- Added comprehensive test coverage for edgit npx spawning
- Tests verify all edgit subcommands route correctly through npx

This patch resolves the CI failure caused by importing `runCLI` from an
unpublished version of edgit, and establishes a sustainable pattern for
version-independent CLI tool integration.
